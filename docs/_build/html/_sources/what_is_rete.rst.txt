What is Retentioneering?
========================

Retentioneering is a Python framework and library
(`github link <https://github.com/retentioneering/retentioneering-tools>`__)
to assist product
analysts and marketing analysts as it makes it easier to process and
analyze clickstreams, event streams, trajectories, and event logs.
You can segment users, clients (agents), build ML pipelines to predict
agent category or probability of target event based on historical data.

In a common scenario you can use raw data from Google Analytics BigQuery
stream or any other silimal streams in form of events and their timestamps
for users, and Retentioneering is all you need to explore the user behavior
from that data, it can reveal much more insights than funnel analytics, as
it will automatically build the behavioral segments and their patterns,
highlighting what events and pattern impact your conversion rates, retention
and revenue.

Retentioneering extends Pandas, NetworkX, Scikit-learn for in-depth
processing of event sequences data, specifically Retentioneering provides
a powerful environment to perform an in-depth analysis of customer
journey maps, bringing behavior-driven segmentation of users and machine
learning pipelines to product analytics.

You don't need to be a Pandas expert, all the functions are specifically
designed for analytics tasks, reduce data wrangling and simplify data
cleaning and visualization.

Product analysts can apply Retentioneering Tools as a Python framework
to explore, grow, and optimize the product based on deep analysis of user
trajectories. Using Retentioneering you can vectorize clickstream logs
and cluster user trajectories to automatically identify common successful
or churn patterns. You can explore those patterns using our tools such
as graph visualizer, step matrix, multiple clustering, and segmentation
engines, and many others.

If you have csv datasets you can start with user behaviour data and try
Retentioneering with "pip install retentioneering" and a few lines of
code. Sample datasets are included in package for quick start.
